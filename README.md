# Express Flashcards

This is a simple flashcards application that I wrote while being in quarantine in Spain. I had plenty of free time and I decided to spend it on learning something new. I decided to polish my Spanish. But what's better from learning a language? Writing an app to learn it.

Was this project complex enough to require Vuex, express or even Vue.js? I don't think so, but it was a nice opportunity to learn something new (Jest, Express.js) and refresh known things (Vue, Vuex). 

## Installation

### Client

Client uses `vue-cli` to run a simple Vue app. 

```
cd client
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Server

Server uses `express.js`. Database is `JSON` based and uses `lowdb`.

```
cd server
npm install
npm run serve
```
