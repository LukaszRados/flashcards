# Express Flashcards

A simple flashcards application written in Vue.JS on frontend and Express.js on backend. The main aim of the app is for me to learn new cool stuff (Express) and refresh stuff I already know (Vue). It is also a way to spend quarantine learning something new by actually procrastinating (why would I learn Spanish as I planned if I can write an app to learn Spanish instead) 💁🏻‍♂️
